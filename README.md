The VeritaseumToken & Veritaseum Crowd-sale TokenPurchase Smart Contracts

The VeritaseumToken is an ERC20 compliant Ethereum token. The TokenPurchase contract has features to enable users to purchase *VERI* tokens during a Initial Coin Offer (ICO).
The code-base makes use of Zeppelin and its standard templates, Safemath and other standard solidity best practices.
All non-standard functions are unit tested.

For more information about the ICO and usage of the TokenPurchase contract read the [tutorial here](https://github.com/RFVenter/Veritaseum/blob/master/tutorial/Veritaseum%20Tutorial.pdf)

Tokens are non-refundable, even if the minimum target is not reached.
